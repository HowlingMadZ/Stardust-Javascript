# Stardust-Javascript
An Javascript port of the amazing Stardust Particle System.

Early working demo:
https://howlingmadz.github.io/Stardust-Javascript/


I noticed there didn't seem to be a particle solution that I would like to see for simple html5 websites, so I decided I am going to try to port one from as3, at least the parts I need, and eventually maybe with a few fixes that the other doesn't have.

Documentation I first found:
